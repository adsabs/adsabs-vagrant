#Peers use the former port to connect to other peers. 
#Such a connection is necessary so that peers can communicate, for example, to agree upon the order of updates. 
#More specifically, a ZooKeeper server uses this port to connect followers to the leader. 
#When a new leader arises, a follower opens a TCP connection to the leader using this port. 
#Because the default leader election also uses TCP, we currently require another port for leader election. 
#This is the second port in the server entry.
